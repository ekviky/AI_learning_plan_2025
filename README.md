# 🧠 AI Learning Plan for Computational Biology Leadership

Welcome! This repository documents a 3-month learning journey (June–September 2025) aimed at helping a leader in computational biology stay sharp and develop as a change agent energizing teams that tackle data-driven decision making to reduce health inequity.

- Augment coding skills with advanced AI capabilities 
- Understand AI/LLM trends in omics & real-world data (RWD)
- Build and share a hands-on AI prototype

## 🎯 SMART Goal

| Element     | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **S**pecific | Learn AI/LLM concepts in healthcare; build small prototype |
| **M**easurable | Courses/articles by July, Coding exercises by August, project by September |
| **A**chievable | Uses existing tools (GitHub, R, Python, DataCamp, etc.), 4–5 hrs/week |
| **R**elevant | Supports role as manager of computational biologists |
| **T**ime-bound | Phased: July (concepts), August (hands-on), September (project) |

  - [Ben’s Bites](https://www.bensbites.co/)
  - Nature Biotech AI reviews

- ** 📺 Webinars **:
  - NIH/Nature: AI in Biomedicine
  - Datacamp: *AI in Healthcare*

#### ✅ Deliverables (by July 5)
- `ai_trends_summary.md`: 1-page summary of AI trends in biomedicine
- Short list of 1–2 interesting omics/RWD use cases

---

### 🧪 Phase 2: Hands-On Coding & LLMs (July–August)

**Focus**: Build confidence and experiment with bio LLMs & toolkits.

- ⏱️ Time: ~4–5 hrs/week

#### 📘 Courses
- [LinkedIn Learning: Python Essential Training](https://www.linkedin.com/learning)
- [GitHub Learning Lab: Intro to Python](https://lab.github.com/)

#### 🧬 Explore
- HuggingFace `transformers` + notebooks for BioGPT, PubMedBERT
- RWD libraries or datasets (OpenTargets, UniProt, etc.)
- Google Colab notebooks for biomedical LLMs

#### ✅ Deliverables (by August 31)
- `python_exercises/`: Weekly Python scripts (2 per week, small ML projects eg omics classification, RWD summaries)
- `llm_experiments/`: Annotated notebooks from bio LLM trials (fork 2)
- Document learning progress in `/logs/` or Wiki

---

### 🛠️ Phase 3: Prototype AI-Driven Tool (Aug–Sept)

**Focus**: Build and document a mini AI-powered project.

- ⏱️ Time: ~5 hrs/week

#### 🧠 Project Ideas
- PubMed triage tool using BioLLM
- Omics dataset dashboard/annotator with GPT-4o
- RWD summarizer or dashboard (w LangChain)
- Simple AI chatbot summarizing variant interpretations (LangChain or Streamlit)
  
#### 🔨 Tools to Consider
- Streamlit
- LangChain
- BioGPT
- HuggingFace
- GitHub Copilot
- Pinecone, Azure HealthBot

#### ✅ Deliverables (by Sept 30)
- `project/`: Working prototype (notebook, Colab, or app)
- `project_summary.md`: 5-slide style overview of outcome (what you built, learned, and next steps)
