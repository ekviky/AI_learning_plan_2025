# 🧠 AI Learning Plan for Computational Biology Leadership

Welcome! This repository documents a 3-month learning journey (June–September 2025) aimed at helping a leader in computational biology:

- Refresh coding skills
- Understand AI/LLM trends in omics & real-world data (RWD)
- Build and share a hands-on AI prototype

---

## 🎯 SMART Goal

| Element     | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **S**pecific | Learn AI/LLM concepts in healthcare; build small prototype |
| **M**easurable | Courses/articles by July, Python exercises by August, project by September |
| **A**chievable | Uses GitHub, R, Python, DataCamp, etc., 4–5 hrs/week |
| **R**elevant | Supports role as manager of computational biologists |
| **T**ime-bound | Phased: July (concepts), August (hands-on), September (project) |

## 📅 Timeline

### 📘 Phase 1: AI Trends & Concepts (June–Early July)

**Focus**: Stay up-to-date on AI/LLMs in omics, RWD, and healthcare. This field is moving fast. 

- ⏱️ Time: ~3–4 hrs/week

#### 🔗 Resources
- **Podcasts**:
  - *The Bioinformatics Chat*
  - *TWIML AI Podcast*
  - *AI in Business*

- **Articles & Blogs**:
  - [The Sequence](https://thesequence.substack.com)
  - [Ben’s Bites](https://www.bensbites.co/)
  - Nature Biotech AI reviews

- **Webinars**:
  - NIH/Nature: AI in Biomedicine
  - Datacamp: *AI in Healthcare*

#### ✅ Deliverables (by July 5)
- `ai_trends_summary.md`: 1-page summary of AI in biomedicine
- Short list of 1–2 interesting omics/RWD use cases

---

### 🧪 Phase 2: Hands-On Python & LLMs (July–August)

**Focus**: Build confidence with Python and experiment with bio LLMs.

- ⏱️ Time: ~4–5 hrs/week

#### 📘 Courses
- [LinkedIn Learning: Python Essential Training](https://www.linkedin.com/learning)
- [GitHub Learning Lab: Intro to Python](https://lab.github.com/)
- [Datacamp: ML Fundamentals](https://www.datacamp.com/)
- [Datacamp: Deep Learning Fundamentals](https://www.datacamp.com/)

#### 🧬 Explore
- HuggingFace `transformers` + notebooks for BioGPT, PubMedBERT
- RWD libraries or datasets (OpenTargets, UniProt, etc.)

#### ✅ Deliverables (by August 31)
- `python_exercises/`: Weekly Python scripts (2 per week)
- `llm_experiments/`: Annotated notebooks from bio LLM trials
- Document learning progress in `/logs/` or Wiki

---

### 🛠️ Phase 3: Prototype AI-Driven Tool (Aug–Sept)

**Focus**: Build and document a mini AI-powered project.

- ⏱️ Time: ~5 hrs/week

#### 🔧 Project Ideas
- PubMed triage tool using BioLLM
- Omics dataset annotator with GPT-4o
- RWD summarizer or dashboard
- Simple AI chatbot (LangChain or Streamlit)

#### 🔨 Tools to Consider
- Streamlit
- LangChain
- HuggingFace
- GitHub Copilot
- Pinecone, Azure HealthBot

#### ✅ Deliverables (by Sept 30)
- `project/`: Working prototype (notebook, Colab, or app)
- `project_summary.md`: 5-slide style overview of outcome
